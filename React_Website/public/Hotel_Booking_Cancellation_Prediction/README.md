# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
- Developed using Python.

- The increasing number of cancellations in the hotel industry demands a Machine Learning-based solution to predict which bookings are likely to be canceled. Hotels are grappling with this issue and have sought data-driven solutions from your firm. After analyzing the provided data, I identified the factors that strongly influence booking cancellations. I then built a predictive model capable of forecasting which bookings are likely to be canceled in advance. These insights can be utilized to formulate profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
