# Master Classification

- Developed using Python and MSSQl

- I engineered an advanced AI-driven system that intelligently classifies line items by their SKUs, generating a comprehensive master classification for all line items. This solution enhances operational efficiency by accurately categorizing each item as a service, inventory, or other relevant type, streamlining inventory management and decision-making processes.
