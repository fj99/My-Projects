# Extract Master

- Developed using Angular for the front-end and C# .NET Core for the back-end, this application is not compatible with GitHub Pages for deployment.

- Designed and developed a centralized, self-service ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) platform supporting multiple extraction sources including APIs, SFTP, S3, relational databases, and Azure services. Enabling flexible data transformation to various formats/types and seamless loading into target databases.

- Implemented a user-friendly web based front end for self service management, allowing non-technical users to add/configure new data extracts, adjust parameters, activate predefined transformations (including column-level granularity), and perform on the fly data type conversions.
