        "description": "As interim Lead Full Stack Developer at Pet-Vet, I design and build mission-critical applications, architect data infrastructure, and drive innovation across the enterprise. I created and own two cornerstone platforms: Data Farm, which reduced the company's month-end financial close process from several days to under 3 hours, and Watchdog, a dynamic ETL system that processes data from 700+ clinics daily, powering essential business operations by handling hundreds of terabytes within hours. My role spans full-stack development (Angular 18 / .NET Core 8 & 9), database architecture, server management (IIS/SQL Server), and AI strategy. I lead the internal AI team, serve as substitute lead developer, and regularly collaborate with executive leadership to align tech initiatives with business goals. A key highlight includes upgrading the company's SQL Server infrastructure from 2013 to 2024 with zero downtime, ensuring a seamless transition for all enterprise apps. Skills & Tools: Angular 18, .NET Core 8 & 9, SQL Server, IIS, ETL pipelines, AI Systems, DevOps, System Architecture. Business Impact: Streamlined financial operations, enabled scalable data ingestion, strengthened infrastructure reliability, and aligned technology with enterprise growth strategy."

I played a central role in developing and managing the university's Drupal-based main website, delivering responsive, accessible content aligned with institutional priorities. A key achievement includes consolidating 12 disparate databases into a unified schema, dramatically improving data integrity and reducing maintenance overhead. I also enhanced mission-critical systems such as the Guest Sign-In System and Student Staff Portal—integrating APIs, automating tasks via Linux Cron Jobs, and implementing scalable PHP/MySQL solutions. As the lead of a 4-person development team for nearly two years, I streamlined onboarding processes, introduced version control (Git), and established thorough documentation protocols via Confluence to ensure project continuity. I also successfully led multiple server migrations, boosting reliability and performance across the IT infrastructure. Skills & Tools: Drupal, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Git, Cron Jobs, Linux, Confluence, API Integration. Business Impact: Reduced database redundancy, improved system uptime, automated key workflows, and elevated team productivity through technical leadership and structured documentation."
