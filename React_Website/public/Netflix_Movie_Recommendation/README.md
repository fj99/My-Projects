# Netflix Movie Recommendation
- Developed using Python.

- Online streaming platforms like **Netflix** have a vast collection of movies in their repository. To enhance customer satisfaction and improve revenue, I built a **Recommendation System** that suggests relevant movies to users based on their historical interactions. The techniques employed in this project extend beyond movies and can be applied to any item for which a recommendation system is desired.

This project encompasses the following recommendation systems:
- Knowledge/Rank-based recommendation system
- Similarity-based Collaborative Filtering
- Matrix Factorization-based Collaborative Filtering
