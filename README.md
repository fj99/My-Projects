## [Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction](https://github.com/fj99/My-Projects/tree/main/Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Prediction)

- Developed using Python.

- The increasing number of cancellations in the hotel industry demands a Machine Learning-based solution to predict which bookings are likely to be canceled. Hotels are grappling with this issue and have sought data-driven solutions from your firm. After analyzing the provided data, I identified the factors that strongly influence booking cancellations. I then built a predictive model capable of forecasting which bookings are likely to be canceled in advance. These insights can be utilized to formulate profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

## [Netflix Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/fj99/My-Projects/tree/main/Netflix_Movie_recommendation)

- Developed using Python.

- Online streaming platforms like **Netflix** have a vast collection of movies in their repository. To enhance customer satisfaction and improve revenue, I built a **Recommendation System** that suggests relevant movies to users based on their historical interactions. The techniques employed in this project extend beyond movies and can be applied to any item for which a recommendation system is desired.

This project encompasses the following recommendation systems:

- Knowledge/Rank-based recommendation system
- Similarity-based Collaborative Filtering
- Matrix Factorization-based Collaborative Filtering

## [PetVetMaster](https://github.com/fj99/My-Projects/tree/main/PetVetMaster)

- Developed in C# .NET Core library, this is not compatible with GitHub Pages for deployment.

- Architected and maintained a centralized enterprise level DLL that serves as the single source of truth for all corporate data models and core utilities across the organization. By standardizing data structures across the entire application ecosystem, this initiative streamlined development workflows and accelerated the deployment of new services, providing a robust, pre-validated foundation for cross-platform data handling and consistency.

---

## [PetVetMaster.API](https://github.com/fj99/My-Projects/tree/main/PetVetMaster.API)

- Developed in C# .NET Core this application is not compatible with GitHub Pages for deployment.

- I engineered a centralized Identity and Access Management (IAM) API that serves as the unified "Source of Truth" for user governance and security across the entire infrastructure. Rather than managing users in silos, I developed a robust system that allows for the global administration of user lifecycles, including the ability to provision access, revoke permissions, and manage application specific Role Based Access Control (RBAC) from a single interface. The API facilitates the dynamic deployment of authentication methods for individual applications and serves as a shared services layer for distributing critical metadata and global configurations. By centralizing these functions, I created a scalable architecture that ensures consistent security standards, streamlines administrative oversight, and provides granular control over how users interact with every application in the ecosystem.

## [Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis](https://github.com/fj99/My-Projects/tree/main/Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Analysis)

- Built using Python

- A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe. In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima tribe.

- Here, I'am analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Diabetes Analysis by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.
