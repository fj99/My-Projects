        "description": "I programmed, updated, and maintained various web apps, department websites, applications, and databases. As part of this work, I restructured and redesigned web apps to improve their integration with databases. Additionally, I created and edited forms for upload on multiple servers and websites. To enhance workflow and application maintenance, I consolidated 12 databases into a single comprehensive database. I was responsible for maintaining and managing the Guest Sign-in System, utilizing PHP and MySQL databases. Furthermore, I updated and managed the Student Staff Portal using JavaScript, and implemented APIs for data retrieval and Cron-Jobs for data pushing and process automation in the Student Sign-in System. I also debugged and modified the schema of the Staff Admin Portal for improved onboarding of new staff. Successfully upgrading the entire system to a new server was another achievement. Alongside these tasks, I developed and updated websites, both front and back end. I implemented Cron Jobs on Linux to generate notification actions and created a fully functional developer instance for testing purposes, ensuring separation from live sites. I also utilized Git for system backups and documented processes using Confluence. Currently, I am leading a team of developers in the department and providing training to new student programmers in the Department of Residence Life."

To enhance customer satisfaction and improve revenue, I built a **Recommendation System** that suggests relevant movies to users based on their historical interactions. The techniques employed in this project extend beyond movies and can be applied to any item for which a recommendation system is desired. This project encompasses the following recommendation systems: - Knowledge/Rank-based recommendation system - Similarity-based Collaborative Filtering- Matrix Factorization-based Collaborative Filtering"

Hotels are grappling with this issue and have sought data-driven solutions from your firm. After analyzing the provided data, I identified the factors that strongly influence booking cancellations. I then built a predictive model capable of forecasting which bookings are likely to be canceled in advance. These insights can be utilized to formulate profitable policies for cancellations and refunds."
