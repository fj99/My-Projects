# Happy Children Daycare
- This was built using php so it can't be showcased on git-pages

- Built a website where parents can go in register/sign in give a way to contact them and register their children for daycare fill in all the information for their kids and a way to contact the employee in charge of their child and employees can also register/sign in to select when they can work, and the system will then give them the kids available to take care of and they have access to those kids information only as well as the parentâ€™s information to contact them.
