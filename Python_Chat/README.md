# Air Message

- This was built using python Flask so it can't be showcased on git-pages

- Built a python chat room encrypted end to end where users can make a username to identify and join a room with a room number that identifies the room they then can talk to other users in that room. Instant messaging web application using Flask (Python web development framework), and Socket.io for real time socket package transfers the goal is to not allow packet capture software like WireShark to capture the network packets.
