# PetVet Master API

- Developed in C# .NET Core this application is not compatible with GitHub Pages for deployment.

- I engineered a centralized Identity and Access Management (IAM) API that serves as the unified "Source of Truth" for user governance and security across the entire infrastructure. Rather than managing users in silos, I developed a robust system that allows for the global administration of user lifecycles, including the ability to provision access, revoke permissions, and manage application specific Role Based Access Control (RBAC) from a single interface. The API facilitates the dynamic deployment of authentication methods for individual applications and serves as a shared services layer for distributing critical metadata and global configurations. By centralizing these functions, I created a scalable architecture that ensures consistent security standards, streamlines administrative oversight, and provides granular control over how users interact with every application in the ecosystem.
